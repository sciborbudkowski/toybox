# toyBox

## A sample iOS application for sharing, byuing and selling toys.

Yes, tons of functionality to add yet. I bring it in free time, however I suspect this project will never be fully finished - it's more a demo project to show my iOS programming skills, knowledge of development using **XCode** and **Swift**.
The project is divided into two main parts:
1. iOS native application with all the functionality for the customer.
2. NodeJS REST API to privide interface to communicate with MongoDB database, handling all user activity.

Current list of keywords for this project is:
- Swift
- XCode
- Combine
- Firebase
- MVVM
- No Storyboard
- UI from code
- Social Service User Login
- CocoaPods
- Design Patterns
- SwiftLint
- REST API (nodejs, express)
- MongoDB
- JSON
- Git
